            <span>The Developer Who Fixed More Than Bugs</span>
        </h2>
        <p align="center">Aarav was a software developer who spent most of his days staring at lines of code, chasing
            bugs that seemed
            smarter than him. Every morning, he promised himself “Today, clean code.” By evening, his code looked like a
            mystery novel with too many plot twists.

            One night, while working late, Aarav noticed an error that kept crashing an app used by a small hospital. It
            wasn’t a big feature or a flashy update—just a tiny bug buried deep in the system. Tired but curious, he
            decided to dig deeper.</p>
        <p align="justify">Hours passed. Coffee cups piled up. Finally, the fix worked.

            The next day, he received a message from the hospital:
            “Your update helped our system run smoothly during an emergency. Thank you.”

            That’s when Aarav realized something important. He wasn’t just writing code. He was solving real problems,
            helping real people—one bug at a time.</p>

        <h2>The Forest That Listened</h2>
        <span>
            <p align="right">At the edge of a quiet village stood an old forest. The trees were tall, their leaves
                whispering secrets
                to the wind, and the river that ran through it sang softly day and night. People believed the forest was
                alive—not just growing, but listening.

                One summer, the rains did not come. The river grew thin, the soil cracked, and the animals moved slowly
                under the heavy sun. The villagers worried, but they also remembered the forest.</p>
            <p align="left">A young girl named Meera walked into the trees and sat beneath a banyan. She placed her hand on the earth
                and closed her eyes. She didn’t ask for rain. She simply listened—to the wind, the birds, the silence.

                That night, clouds gathered quietly. Thunder rolled like a deep breath. Rain fell gently at first, then
                freely, soaking the land. The river swelled, leaves danced, and the forest seemed to smile.

                The villagers said the forest had answered Meera’s prayer.
                Meera knew the truth: nature speaks all the time—but only listens back when we do.

                And from that day on, the village treated the forest not as a resource, but as a friend.</p>
